# EscNotes
Take notes and quickly turn them into physically actionable receipts using the power of ESC/POS.

- Turn development tickets into actual tickets
- Take note of some critical information you cannot lose
- Print secret keys in a OCR-viable piece of media
- ... and many more uses!


This weekend project originates from the Tauri, React & TS in Vite template and leverages Tailwind with shadcn/ui.
